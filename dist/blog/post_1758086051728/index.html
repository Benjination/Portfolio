                “That’s a nice application you have there. It would be a shame if a Chaos Monkey came through and broke parts of it.” This tongue-in-cheek expression, used amongst chaos engineering programmers, is actually representative of an emerging method of white box testing being used by several major companies. Chaos engineering is a method of testing distributed software that deliberately introduces failure and faulty scenarios to verify its resilience (Gunja). Traditionally, white box testing involves looking at the code, testing for failure, and connecting code blocks that hopefully will never fail. Chaos testing takes this one step further and checks how the system would respond if one of these thoroughly vetted parts of the system failed anyway. No one ever plans for part of a system to fail, and it can cause major issues if the system fails during peak user interaction. Often, when a program fails, the incident gives insight into what changes need to be made so that it does not fail again. Chaos testing offers this insight in a controlled, planned, and reversible way. <br>	As most inventions are typically created, Chaos testing was created in 2010 by Netflix with the original concept being that if the system is going to break, it should break when the engineers are awake and can fix it. They wanted a way that they could intentionally break the code during business hours. Netflix needed a testing method that would randomly break components as unpredictably as a monkey loose in the system, and thus the Chaos Monkey was born. Since that time, Netflix has been able to increase their system availability to 99.99%. The complexity of modern systems demands new testing approaches that can effectively test microservices and cloud-based environments where traditional methods fall short.<br>	I recently read an article written by Saif Gunja that outlines the Chaos testing method. The four-step process begins with a hypothesis. The engineer will make an assumption about how the system will respond if a certain feature, method, code-block, or service fails. The assumption they make is that the system will not fail and availability will not be compromised. Step two: The engineer then creates a simulated experiment where the element is tested in a way that is uncertain and working with a higher user demand. If the system fails and disrupts availability, then the hypothesis is broken, and there is more work to be done. Step three: As I stated before, a crash can often give insight into what parts of the system are affected. Those affected parts of the system are then documented, and they make up what is called the “Blast Radius”. When designing the test for the element, engineers might make changes to the base code that isolate the failure to reduce the blast radius. Step 4: All of the insights discovered are documented as cautionary tales the current and future software development teams can consider to make current and future features more robust (Gunja). <br>	The connection between traditional methods of white box testing, and the introduction of Chaos testing as a method of white box testing is in the shared method of systematically observing functionality under controlled conditions. Traditional white box testing examines code paths and function performance given various variable conditions. Chaos testing works in a similar way, but it is able to observe how the entire system of distributed services responds to a controlled failure. Traditional white box testing could be used to test a login system to find edge cases that might be problematic, but it’s not able to show what happens if the entire database of users fails, or how the login system might work when user interaction is very high. The evolution from traditional methods to Chaos testing is the scope. Chaos testing extends traditional white box testing by providing insights into the effect of failures on the entire distributed system rather than only components in the local code base.  <br>	Gunja’s article does a very good job of describing the scientific method and origins of Chaos testing, I wanted to look deeper into the evolution of the method and where it currently stands today. The most recent article I could find on the current state of the method, specifically with Netflix, is in the 2024 article by Anirudh Mendiratta on the Netflix technology Blog. Netflix’s use of Chaos testing has evolved from the humble origins of the Chaos Monkey into a more sophisticated production system. The 2024 article focuses on “Service level prioritized load shedding” and “Intelligent degradation based on service priority” (Mendiratta). The article was spawned from actual infrastructure incidents in 2024. When a system becomes overloaded, the method of load-shedding can be employed to reject low-priority tasks to allow essential tasks as much processing power as possible. This is actually a pretty fundamental idea that has been present in local operating systems for decades, but it does become considerably more complex in distributed systems with microservices and cloud elements. The intelligent use of degradation in this way allows Netflix to maintain streaming capabilities to users even if other systems fail. Remember that Netflix now has 99.99% availability, so this is a system that seems to be working well. The evolution of Ai is now being implemented in these fail-safe systems to predict failure patterns and respond to failures with almost no human interaction at all. This process is a major advancement in Chaos testing. The system can now proactively adjust service levels based on real-time chaos scenarios. This article absolutely validates Gunja’s assertion that Chaos testing is necessary for modern software systems. Moving from a 4-step testing method into an integrated operational strategy displays how far Chaos testing has evolved since the introduction of the Chaos Monkey. <br>	Although the invention of Chaos testing can be attributed to Netflix, they did not keep the concept to themselves. In fact, I could list over twenty major companies that have developed their own style of Chaos testing including Amazon, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Twitch, Etsy, E-bay, Walmart… the list goes on. I wanted to look into other companies that had found success using Chaos testing and in my search, I found a very interesting document from Dell written by Afeefa Shaista. This comprehensive analysis of Chaos testing shows that Chaos testing has moved from being exclusively used by tech giants into other realms like finance, healthcare, and retail. Dell Technologies developed the original specialized practice at Netflix into a mainstream enterprise discipline (Shaista). Chaos Monkey, Gremlin, Litmus, and Pumba are several platforms that evolved from the original concept that make Chaos testing considerably more accessible without developers having to entirely reinvent the wheel. This article from Dell points out that there are shortcomings inherent in the concept like organizational culture and risk tolerance. Some issues within a system are known but ignored since the likelihood of failure is very minimal or are designed in a way that a failure would be the responsibility of a third-party service. Also, Netflix owns Netflix and can be modified using whatever technologies Netflix decides will serve them best. Traditional enterprises like Dell, but not limited to Dell, have very specific adoption processes that consider compliance, regulations, and risk management protocols. For this reason, Dell created a process of gradual implementation and extensive risk mitigation strategies (Shaista). Netflix’s aggressive production testing would not be able to fit into traditional enterprises otherwise.    <br>	The scientific methodology from Gunja, Netflix’s production excellence from Mendiratta, and Dell’s enterprise framework described by Shaista are enough evidence to show that Chaos testing is definitively a necessary and well-executed evolution of white box testing suited for distributed systems. Software Architecture has evolved to incorporate new technologies as they have become available, and so the testing has evolved likewise. Technology only moves forward, so the question is not if Chaos testing will become the new standard, but rather it is whether or not established, traditional enterprises can adapt quickly enough to stay competitive in the modern technological atmosphere. <br><br><br>References<br>(1)	Gunja, Saif.
