                    <p>Nightshade is a new tool developed by Ben Zhou, at the University of Chicago, that is being used to poison the libraries that generative Ai (Artificial intelligence) programs are using to render new artwork based on the work of existing non-Ai (human) artists. This article will explore the brief history of the technologies behind Nightshade and generative Ai, as well as the positive and negative aspects of the technology. Additionally, we will explore the possible reasons for poisoning generative Ai, and what the intentions might be of those involved with Nightshade and similar technologies. </p>

<p>Generative Ai has been in the public eye more now than it ever has been before because of the release of ChatGPT and similar programs. Machine learning and the applications for this seemingly new technology are on the forefront of the research opportunities that I have found at my own University (UTA), and I would imagine it is the focus of a great percentage of all research being conducted in the field of Computer Science in general. The applications of recent generative Ai have had humble beginnings as being mostly text-based, but in the past few years, generative Ai has evolved from being a method to cheat on essays and take shortcuts writing computer code. It has moved into technologies like computer vision in self driving cars, photo manipulation, photographic generative fill, and the rendering of unique and custom artwork on demand in a moment’s time. As this technology becomes more and more powerful, those in control of the World’s governments struggle to keep pace with the rapid innovation. However, in the United States, there are avenues to take when you feel your rights have been violated, and currently there are artists who are following those paths in pursuit of justice. I personally found an interest in this topic because I agree that artist’s claim to intellectual property is valid and for generative Ai to use their hard work with no compensation whatsoever is a violation that needs to be corrected. </p>

<p> Nightshade was introduced ten days ago by Professor Ben Zhao and his team including Ph.D. students Shawn Shan, Wenxin Ding, Josephine Passananti, and Haitao Zheng at the University of Chicago. In their introduction to Nightshade, they describe it as “an optimized prompt-specific poisoning attack where poison samples look visually identical to benign images with matching text prompts (1 Zhao et al.).” For Generative Ai to render new unique artwork, it uses web crawlers to find images that fit the text-based description provided by a user, and then it borrows a little from each image to create a “new” image. This produced image is more like a collage of images that already exist, and when it borrows too heavily from one artist, the result is uncannily derivative in an obvious way. In fact, a user can even make requests such as “I’d like a painting of a bear on a bicycle in the style of Vincent Van Gogh”, and the result may appear so like Van Gogh’s style that people may think he painted the image. Nightshade works by altering the digital version of a human’s artwork in a way that is not noticeable to a human viewer but is noticeable to a web crawler. The artist’s image may be of a cat, but the web crawler reads it as a dog. In the short run, this may save an artist’s image from being used in that request, but the poisoning effect comes after multiple Generative Ai queries. As the image is passed over by the web crawler, it may record that the image is a dog, and even though it doesn’t look like most of the other images of dogs that it has seen, it will log the information for later use. As more people use the Nightshade software to protect their intellectual property, the entire idea of what a dog looks like to that Ai model may become so far off target that the images produced are not usable. Nightshade effectively ruins the Ai’s source library until it is not effective. </p>

<p> Generative Ai is not as new as most people might think. The recent release of ChatGPT and other Ai programs like Perplexity and Claude Ai has made Generative Ai relevant in a way that it has not ever been since its inception in 1956. Artificial Intelligence is a scientific study that did not exist until the Dartmouth Summer Research Project in 1956. The term was coined by a Computer Scientist named John McCarthy and came as a response to the question posed by the well-known Mathematician Alan Turing, “Can machines think” (2 Toloka Team). Since its creation there have been moments that it caught the public interest, such as a chatbot named ELIZA, a bot that could play chess competitively, or predictive text on cell phones, but it was not until the past few years that people started really questioning whether robotic world domination might be a rational fear. In 2018, GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformers) introduced by OpenAi made Alexa look like a Speak-N-Spell, or a Teddy Ruxpin if you prefer. The sudden and abrupt introduction to truly convincing Artificial Intelligence has already changed the information landscape in way that rivals internet search engines. Personally, and I am not alone in this sentiment, I prefer asking Perplexity Ai a direct question and receiving a direct answer than the process of a Google dive to find information. DALL-E is the most recent innovation from OpenAi, released in 2021, and it is the generative Ai that creates images instead of text. Given everything that we know about the progression of Artificial Intelligence, the idea of poisoning the libraries that make this innovation possible borders on a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) Cyber-attack. Systems like Nightshade threaten that innovation, and this is a negative aspect of the technology, but as I will later explain, I believe they are meant to do exactly that.</p>

<p> Historically, general Ethics have been needed to fill the gap between what is legal and right regarding innovative inventions. Nightshade gives digital artists, or any artist that uploads their art into a digital format, a tool to fight back against companies that never asked if it was right or ethical to use existing artwork to generate new art, but only asked if it was possible, and proved that it was. The work of Professor Zhao and his team are published and open, and so I would not consider their efforts to be a form of hacktivism. They are showing that the libraries of existing works can be polluted, and the concept is forcing companies like OpenAi to reconsider what compensation should be considered for the hard work of others. To this end, I believe Nightshade and similar products are making a positive impact on progression in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p> Nightshade is an indication of an evolving relationship between Artificial intelligence and human artists that has so far proven to be conflicting. In the short-term, this offers benefits for human artists, but the long-term effect that this may have on generative Ai is yet to be seen. The need to balance what is ethical and what is necessary will certainly be a challenge for artists, innovators, and policymakers going forward.</p>
