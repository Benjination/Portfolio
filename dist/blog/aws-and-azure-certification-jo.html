                    <p>Weeks 3 & 4</p>

<p>First, I want to tell you about the cloud-based project that I am working on. I have been able to successfully complete all requirements using my Github and Firebase approach, but I have had to make some serious design changes. The design for database storage is so critical if you want to keep your cost low or be a cheapskate like me and try and do everything for free. <br>In my plan for week three I said verbatim, “compare them as I seek the ceiling of Firebase”. Well guess what, I found it, and it wasn’t from posting too many blogs. The project I’m working on now uses a huge database, 10k tuples with 10 elements each, and I use that information for buttons and searches that a user can perform on the deployed website. I wanted to increase performance of my queries and recommended a service called Redis or Memcache. These are programs that consider the data in your database, and how you are calling them, and it optimizes your queries by creating a cache of the results. This means that the first time you query specific information, the program will reach out to the database, gather that information, and then store it on a web service that is separate from Github or Firebase. They offer free tier services, and they are great options if you are paying for Azure or AWS. For large companies, this option makes sense, but I’m a broke college student, so for me I am going to try and implement a free version. The concept is not so complex that an outside service needs to be employed. All I need is to be able to store the data in some kind of data structure that is set to the number or elements in the database. No problem. I can code that. <br>My initial plan was to store every element into one array, and then search that array for my results instead of calling firebase. Then when a specific query is made, the program creates a new link on a linked list that uses the key elements as an id, and contains pointers that point to the data in the original array to make the stored data lighter for the user.  When the query is made again, it finds the array of pointers, grabs the information that the pointers point to, and returns the list. The original query might take 2.3 seconds (An eternity in computer time), but each query after was lightning fast, a fraction of a millisecond. It worked like a dream… See the results below:<br> ![Firebase Ceiling](blog/Images/firebaseCeiling.png)<br>As you may have guessed, 200k reads and 1500 writes is unacceptable for a single user testing the website. I hit the Firebase ceiling like an elevator with jet engines. Back to the drawing board. <br>I had to rethink my strategy. The problem was that every time I loaded the website, it pulled all 10,000 tuples, regardless of what I did on the website. Turns out, you can have outstanding performance, or you can have low cost easily, but it’s very difficult to have both. I scrapped the broken database and created a new one, then I restructured my codebase so that each search accessed the firebase for only the data it needed. Once it pulled the data it cached the results not as pointers, but as structs. This does make the data stored on the client’s device heavier if they do every search possible on the website, but most users are only going to search the data they need. This dropped my reads-per-session from 10k to maybe 800-1000 or less. So, firebase is much more affordable. I also had to add a timer to the cache so that it automatically releases the cache storage after five minutes (in case the data is updated by the site host, me), or when the user closes the site. That way the cookies don’t stay forever. For a database with only 10,000 tuples, this works fine, but in truly large systems, you could not store the cached data on the user’s computer, and you would have to use a third-party cache service like Redis or Memcache. <br>Redis and Memcache were considered because they are the go-to services for distributed systems using big data. The first problem that I ran into is that Github only allows static websites for the free tier. There is a method to use third party systems by connecting them through Firebase instead of Github, but that also requires premium features offered on paid plans. I decided to pay for the Firebase Blaze plan, but not to connect Redis. When I signed up for the Blaze plan, they gave me a $300 dollar credit. That’s actually better than AWS or Azure offer. I still get all of the free reads, writes, and deletes up to the cap, but after that they charge me fractions of cents for each call. They allowed me to put a cap on the spending too so that it doesn’t get out of control. I set it to $25 dollars. We’ll see how long that lasts. <br>For the next two weeks, I’m going to stick with the plan about 50/50. I will be using this document as my blog post since it includes the cost analysis for the project I’m working on, but the second part of the plan: “Implement advanced features like monitoring, CI/CD Pipelines, and security while leading knowledge sharing and exam prep with peers”, I will be changing to a plan to continue finding free ways to implement enterprise-level capabilities that match AWS, Azure, and other third-party web services. <br></p>
