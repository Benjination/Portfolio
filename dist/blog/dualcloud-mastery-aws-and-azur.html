                    <p>This semester I have been given the unique opportunity to explore cloud computing in a way that will certainly benefit me greatly in both Software Testing (CSE 5321) and Cloud Computing & Big Data (CSE 6332). This venture will also add skills to my resume as I enter the industry and add expertise to my arsenal as I navigate unfamiliar waters in my future. Cloud computing allows individuals and organizations to store, access, and process a wide variety of files and data types through host servers on a globally available network. Amazon<br>Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure (Azure) are the two most popular cloud hosting services used in the Software Engineering industry. The similarities are glaringly obvious in that they are both comprehensive services that include a broad set of cloud services: storage, networking, databases, artificial intelligence, security features, etc. Each service offers global availability and redundancy in their massive service coverage area, and they are very comparable in price structure. AWS has been around four years longer than Azure,<br>but Azure is rapidly making up ground and has become the main competition for the undisputed industry titan. Azure has already gained the support and patronage of major companies like Nike, Dell, and Starbucks. AWS serves Netflix, Adobe, and Spotify. It seems the two are on par and capable of matching the other in every aspect. So, why choose one over the other? What makes the providers diXerent from one another? I aim to find out through my personal journey into cloud computing this semester by learning both platforms and comparing them on a biweekly blog.<br>I am inspired to take this journey of discovery for multiple reasons, but the main interest I have is exploring cloud computing and adding this skill to the talents that I have already acquired in my collegiate experience. I am motivated to learn Azure first because this semester I am taking Cloud Computing & Big Data with Professor Levine. When I asked Dr. Levine which was the industry standard between the two, he told me that a year ago he<br>would have said AWS with no question, but now Azure may be the better of the two. It’s certainly more convenient for UTA students because of a free trial it gives for students (I have not begun with AWS, but I imagine they offer an intro deal as well). Still, Dr Levine and Dr Levine’s teaching assistant were back and forth about the differences, so I left feeling somewhat unsatisfied. To truly find the diXerences would take considerable research, and it would require someone with an inclination, a plan, and eight-weeks to dedicate to the idea. It would seem I am poised perfectly to seize the opportunity. The perspective that I will have on Cloud computing will be unique when this semester is over because I will have experience with both of the major contenders in Cloud computing services, and not only will I be sharing my experience throughout the process on the blog that I maintain on my portfolio available on my website, but when I enter the Software Engineering industry, I will be able to share my expertise with others. I believe this will be a major boon for the lucky company that gives me my first opportunity. In this report I will share the broad strokes of my action plan, but I have a more<br>detailed plan already that I will be implementing and describing throughout the semester in<br>my blog and in the discussion boards. The plan is as follows:</p>

<p>Weeks:</p>

<p>1. Set up AWS and Azure accounts, establish a blog series, create first blog post.<br>2. Focus on understanding AWS basics and compare to what I have learned already in Azure (not much so far). Possibly entice classmates in 6332 to participate with me or at least discuss my observations.<br>3. Continue progress with Azure and create “identical” project/projects on AWS. Blog about similarities and minor or major differences. <br>4. Transform progress so far into online web application on both services. Note challenges with either compared to the other. <br>5. Finalize deployment on both platforms and create detailed cost and performance analysis blog post. <br>6. Implement advanced features like monitoring, CI/CD Pipelines, and security while leading knowledge sharing and exam prep with peers<br>7. Complete the AWS certification, prep for Azure exam, compile some form of comprehensive guide to both cloud services in blog post.<br>8. Finish Azure certification, wrap up documentation and publish any unspoken conclusions to blog, present project to the community.</p>

<p>I recognize that this is a huge undertaking and that most people would prefer to master one service before moving to the next, and I intend to dedicate as much time to this endeavor as I can spare. My expected outcome is two certifications, new avenues of employment by meeting new employer prerequisites, and a much better understanding of cloud computing. There are few services that are not online in some facet in today’s high-<br>tech landscape. By adapting to this environment before joining the ranks, I can use my knowledge of cloud computing in communication with my colleagues to expedite my ascension into industry leadership. I have no doubt there will be challenges in managing my time appropriately, a very minimal starting knowledge base, and in not knowing many people with which I can share and discuss my journey’s progress. Still, what new journey<br>does not come without some trial and tribulation? I am truly excited to begin exploring into cloud computing.</p>
