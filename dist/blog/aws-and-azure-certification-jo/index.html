                    <p>AWS and Azure Certification Journey with Technical Blogging<br>Week 1 & 2<br>Benjamin Niccum</p>

<p>	So, I have accomplished a lot this week, but I will have to change my blog’s direction based on what I have learned during these two weeks. My goal for week 1 was to Setup accounts on AWS and Azure, establish a blog series, and create my first blog post. The first differences I can tell you between AWS and Azure is that Azure will let you join without inputting a credit card where AWS requires a credit/debit card to be added, but has an assurance message that says free users will not be charged on the credit card unless they upgrade from a free account to a paid account. AWS and Azure both offer $100 dollars in free credit for you to explore the basic features. AWS says you can earn another $100 by exploring key AWS services. I have not created an AWS account yet because I’ve had to reconsider my approach based on what I have already learned with Azure. We are three weeks into exploring Azure, and my free $100 is gone. If I want to continue using Azure, I’d have to pay hard-earned real dollars, and I’m not going to do that. As you can see in the following image, Database hosting is wildly expensive on Azure. <br>Breakdown of Azure expenditures: <br><Image of Azure Expenditures></p>

<p>In regard to AWS, I want to really plan an approach that gets me closer to an AWS certification, so I need to map that out before I begin my trial membership. That’s getting pushed to next week. Now I’m going to give you a pro-tip, but don’t tell everyone because if too many people find out, it will certainly ruin it for everyone. As soon as my Azure maxxed out, I had already submitted a link to a website as an assignment. That website was down because I have no credit with Azure. I had to figure out a different way to deploy. So, I moved the database to Firebase. They offer free storage for small projects. There is probably a ceiling on that, but I have yet to find it. Then I deployed through GitHub pages. As long as your repository is public, you can deploy for free. This is a free way to launch a website, and the only cost you will incur is for the custom domain name if you choose to have one. As for the custom domain name, you can grab one on Cloudflare for about $13 per year. That’s for a .com, but there are even cheaper options if you don’t use .com. That is the tech stack I will be using going forward for my cloud computing class. <br>	One major success I had this week was setting up a blog section on my website where I can post blogs. I used my LEADON report as my first blog, and it can be found here: https://benjaminniccum.com/blog/dualcloud-mastery-aws-and-azur. <br>The blog system I added to my website is actually way more clever than you might think. A visitor to the site will be able to read the blogs, share links, navigate back to the main website, etc… Typical user experience. However, I need a way to edit, delete, and add posts on the website, and I didn’t want to have to add files to my web app every time. So I created a back room with email/password authentication and hid it somewhere on the page. Let me know if you can find it. Upon successful Authentication, it opens a blog management section where I can manage the blogs that are all uploaded to the Firestore database. I’ll attach an image below so you can see what the secret area looks like. <br>Secret blog management area: <br><Image of blog backroom></p>

<p>	For week two, my goal was to familiarize myself with AWS and compare it to what I know about Azure, and to put together a study group from my Cloud Computing class. The first part is being pushed until next week so that I can get in and explore AWS with my free trial. The second part however was a great success. I was able to recruit two fellow students: Li and Mohammed. Li is very good with Azure already and has been helping me setup necessary tools like Azure Data Studio and Azure Storage Explorer. Mohammed is learning, like I am, and we help each other study for exams and projects. <br>	My plan for the next two weeks is to setup AWS with a direct approach to becoming certified, and continue my progress with a Firebase/Github combo instead of Azure. I will look for projects for AWS that are similar to projects I’m deploying through Github and compare them as I seek the ceiling of Firebase. For week four, I might have to alter that plan. Instead of making one large AWS project, I might have to create several small ones and detail how they compare to similar functions on Github. My overall goal now is to see if there is an entirely free way to do the things that Azure and AWS are capable of doing. <br></p>
