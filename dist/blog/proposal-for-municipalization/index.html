                INTRODUCTION<br><br>Living on the East side of Fort Worth and having worked in both the Stop-Six neighborhood of Fort Worth and the West side near Camp Bowie and 820, I have seen a considerable amount of homeless people panhandling on corners or in front of convenience stores. I have also seen a great deal of entrepreneurship in these same communities with food trucks, pop-up item tents, and unique establishments. Even the act of panhandling in itself requires a degree of dedication and motivation. The people in these lower income neighborhoods are by no means lazy, but they are often granted less opportunity to earn money in traditional ways.<br><br>RATIONALE FOR MY INVESTIGATION<br><br>Local government already has in place several programs that could be modified slightly to absorb the cost of planting fruit trees in local parks and alongside public highways. The Parks and Recreation department currently manages 12,495 acres of government land in 291 public parks. The Tarrant Parks and Recreation department is budgeted $11,122,832 on operations overall for 2021 and $492,000 on planting trees specifically according to sources within the Parks and Recreation department acquired via phone on 06/16/2021 (Fox, Youngblood, & Sherpa). The trees they are currently planting provide shade, deter erosion, and benefit the environment, but they do not produce food. Texas government also has a program called the Wildflower program that plants 30,000 seeds each year along Texas Highways covering 3,233 miles of government owned land (Also included in Parks and Recreation budget). The flowers they plant require less maintenance than a field of grass might and protect the land from erosion better than the grass would. I propose that some of the funds from these two programs, and possibly other programs like Tanf and Medicaid be reallocated to cover the initial expense of planting fruit-bearing trees to create a market for homeless individuals to earn income and reduce hunger. I would also like to propose a plan to monetize the operation to replace the sacrificed funds and generate new money for future government programs.<br><br>PROCEDURE<br><br>Through extensive online research, and interviews with local government and farmer’s market representatives, I will examine the real possibility of implementing a local government program that will help feed the homeless and give them a way to earn money by selling fruit directly to consumers, indirectly to local farmer’s markets, or even more indirectly to local government institutions to be resold through government owned food co-ops. I will begin my research by answering these five questions:<br><br>1. Which government programs that already exist could be modified to implement fruit tree planting, i.e. The TxDot Wildflower program and Parks and Recreation department?<br><br>2. How would this affect the current local farmer’s market retailers, and could this create a market that does not currently exist?<br><br>3. How might this negatively affect the government programs from which the funds must be pulled, and is there a viable plan to generate new money over a specific timeline to replace the money these programs are sacrificing? <br><br>4. Would it be possible to incentivize local citizens to plant fruit trees in their own yards near the front of their property by allowing these purchases to be used in the same way that donations are currently included in tax write-offs?<br><br>5. How receptive are local farmer’s markets to purchasing fruit from independent sellers, and how expensive might it be to create local co-ops for the reselling of collected fruit?<br><br>It is my goal to compose a realistic plan to reduce hunger, employ an unconventional and willing workforce, create new government funds, reduce unemployment, and increase overall macroeconomic quality of life for the Fort Worth Community. <br><br>REFERENCES<br><br>Wildflower Program.
